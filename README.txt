Hi!

This is my first project in C++! I put this together over the course of a week or so
as a way to learn C++, and I rather enjoyed it. Although this was also my first time using
raylib 2.5, I have been happily using raylib 2.0 for small projects for over a year.
Additionally, I have taken classes in C and Java, so I was already familiar with much of
C++'s syntax, and I'm not a total stranger to object-oriented programming.

That said, I'm learning C++ through self-teaching, so I don't know all the conventions
and may have made some weird choices or mistakes. If you have any suggestions or
criticisms please feel free to let me know!

A detailed description of how this program works is included in the comments of
PendulumMain.cpp and Node.cpp
